          # Specific guidelines for Abies project
          guidelines: |
            This is the Abies framework - a pure functional MVU architecture for Blazor WebAssembly.
            
            When reviewing, pay special attention to:
            1. Pure functional programming - Update functions must be pure
            2. Immutability - State should use immutable records
            3. MVU pattern - Model-View-Update separation
            4. Type safety - Leverage C# type system
            5. Test coverage - All new code should have tests
            6. Documentation - Public APIs need XML comments
            7. Security - Check for XSS, injection vulnerabilities
            8. Performance - Virtual DOM efficiency
            
            Framework-specific rules:
            - Messages should inherit from base Message type
            - Commands must be pure and composable
            - No side effects in Update function
            - Follow existing code style and conventions
            - Ensure CHANGELOG.md is updated for user-facing changes
